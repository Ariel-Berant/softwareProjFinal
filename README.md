## Description
This is our project in the software project course in TAU. This project performs the Kmeans++ and symNMF algorithm on given vectors, and returns the results. <br>
We have used the CPython API to perform the bulk of the calculations in C, and some of the other calculations and logic in python. <br>
The project is documented in the files to explain the meaning of the functions, and more. <br>
Responsibility of any use\misuse of the code in this repository is upon the user.
